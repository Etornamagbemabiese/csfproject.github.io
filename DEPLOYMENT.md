# Disney AI Concierge - GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy your Disney AI Concierge app to GitHub Pages for free hosting.

## 🚀 Quick Deployment Steps

### 1. Prepare Your Repository
1. Make sure all your code is committed and pushed to your GitHub repository
2. Ensure your repository is public (required for free GitHub Pages)

### 2. Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on **Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to **Pages** section in the left sidebar
4. Under **Source**, select **GitHub Actions**
5. Save the settings

### 3. Deploy Automatically
The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically deploy your app when you push to the `main` branch:

```bash
# Build and test locally first
npm install
npm run build

# If everything looks good, push to trigger deployment
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy to GitHub Pages"
git push origin main
```

### 4. Access Your Live Site
Once deployed, your app will be available at:
**https://etornam.github.io/csfproject**

## 🔧 Manual Deployment (Alternative)

If you prefer manual deployment:

1. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy the `build` folder:**
   - Go to your repository settings
   - Navigate to Pages section
   - Select "Deploy from a branch"
   - Choose `gh-pages` branch and `/` folder
   - Or use the `gh-pages` npm package:
     ```bash
     npm install --save-dev gh-pages
     npm run deploy
     ```
